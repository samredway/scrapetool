# Scrape Tool

This is a web app that let you scrape websites for text data. There is a frontend allowing you to test a given url and prompt and see the results, as well as an api that allows you to do the same thing programatically.

The fundamental aim here is to create a tool that allows you to scrape websites for textual and other data by entering a plain english prompt and a url. The tool uses powerful LLMs to parse and extract the data, meaning someone with no technical knowledge can scrape any website.

## Licence

The underlying library is [ScrapeAI](https://github.com/samredway/scrapeai) and that libray is free and open source.

However this tool is designed as a potential commercial product and for now is licensed under the [LICENCE.txt](LICENCE.txt) file.
